        <p>Cord is an application that allows users to not only share their
          music instrumentals with others, but it allows others who are looking
          for instrumentals, an easy place to find them. Our goal is to make
          it as easy as possible for our users to accomplish these two things. We
          are very early in our development process, and we plan to add new
          features and ways to make the user experince the best it can possibly be.
          We are open to feedback and suggestions and we love to hear from our users.
